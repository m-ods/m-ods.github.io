    <h2>About me:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I live in sunny Singapore 🇸🇬 with my wife and daughter.</li>
      <li>I'm a Support Engineer at AssemblyAI. Day-to-day, I work with developers to quickly implement our API. I also update our docs, file bug reports, and engage with the community on our Discord server.</li>
      <li>I speak 4 languages 🇺🇸🇩🇪🇧🇷🇨🇳 and play 3 musical instruments 🎸🎹🥁. I try to keep fit through running, lifting, and calisthenics.</li>
      <li>I taught myself to code by doing challenges on <a href="https://codingbat.com">CodingBat</a>.</li>
      <li>I'm interested in building creative automations for myself and my friends. In the past, I started doing this with Pipedream, but these days my weapon of choice is usually Python with FastAPI.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What I've built:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/AssemblyAI/cookbook">AssemblyAI's cookbook</a>, our repository of implementation ideas and code examples for developers.</li>
      <li>A PATCH endpoint for AssemblyAI's API that lets users easily edit their transcripts. <a href="https://github.com/m-ods/patchthing">patchthing</a></li>
      <li>An app that counts my kettlebell swings for me. <i>Launching soon</i></li>
      <li>An app that transcribes a multi-person conversation in real-time, with one channel per speaker. <a href="https://github.com/m-ods/talktalk">talktalk</a></li>
    </ul>
